## Getting Started (Recommended)

Netlify can run in any frontend web environment, but the quickest way
to try it out is by running it on a pre-configured starter site with
Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/faeldon/faeldon-website)

After clicking the link, youâ€™ll authenticate with GitHub and choose a
repository name. Netlify will then automatically create a repository
in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template.

Finally, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you
to the site dashboard when the build is complete.
