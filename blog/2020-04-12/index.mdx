The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) collates data from various field offices on the cost of assistance provided to families affected by COVID 19 in the Philippines.

The situation report is available every 6:00 am and 6:00 pm as published on the [DROMIC COVID19 webpage](https://dromic.dswd.gov.ph/coronoavirus-disease-covid-19-31-dec-2019/).

I wrote scripts to clean, geocode and convert the MS Word Documents to [machine readable data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eS44h4aIvjXspFFnTd3rEepKaL0nQNcMX_Z8Jnfclp4/edit?usp=sharing) and made it available via a [public dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/james.faeldon#!/vizhome/PhilippinesCOVID19CostofAssistance/Dashboard).

You can find [the entire code on Github](https://github.com/altcoder/dromic-covid19-sitreps).
