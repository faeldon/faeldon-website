### A live code demo on markdown powered by [gatsby-mdx](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-mdx)

```js react-live
const onClick = () => {
  alert("It's Alive!");
};
render(<button onClick={onClick}>Click Me!</button>);
```

Welcome to my typography driven blog site, focusing on content, a bit of code & minimal style.

It follows the [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org) by using Git as a single source of truth, and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) for continuous deployment, and CDN distribution.

You can find the entire source code of this site on [github](https://github.com/faeldon/faeldon-website).
