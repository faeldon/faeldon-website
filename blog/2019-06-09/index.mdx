### Philippine administrative boundaries in geojson and topojson format at various resolution.

[Github Project](https://github.com/faeldon/philippines-json-maps)

The github repository contains Philippines vector maps suitable
for use on web applications either as an overlay to interactive
map services using [Leaflet](www.leafletjs.com) or rendered on
natively using [d3js](www.d3js.org).

## Background

A few years ago, I was looking for low-resolution map files that
I can use to render natural hazards map on the web. I found high-
resolution shapefiles but I still have to do post-processing to
optimize the maps to satisfy my requirements. Basically, high-
resolution shapefiles are not really practical for rendering web
maps because of their file size.

I needed vector maps that can render fast. Also, I wanted to
partition the map data so I can incrementally load portions of
the map asynchronously. So I wrote a few scripts to do the
conversion and partitioning that I needed.

## How it Works

1. Shapefiles to GeoJSON conversion with high fidelity was done using [ogr2ogr](https://gdal.org/programs/ogr2ogr.html).

2. The high fidelity GeoJSON file is "downsampled" using [mapshaper](https://mapshaper.org/) with `-simplify` flag at 10% (hires), 1% (medres), 0.1% (lowres) settings.

3. GeoJSON is then converted to a more compact topojson format using [geo2topo](https://github.com/topojson/topojson).

The tools mentioned above can be used to do all sorts of
post-processing on your shapefile. You can refer to the [scripts](https://github.com/faeldon/philippines-json-maps/tree/master/scripts)
to see how I did it. I would recommend having a look at these
tools if you want to customize your own transformations.

## Sample Maps

Files are generated for all locations in the Philippines at all
administrative levels.

The maps are partitioned per area and administrative levels. For
example, each region map will show provincial boundaries in that region.

Here is for Region II, Cagayan Valley Region:

[provinces-region-cagayanvalleyregionii.topo.0.1.json](https://github.com/faeldon/philippines-json-maps/blob/master/topojson/provinces/hires/provinces-region-cagayanvalleyregionii.topo.0.1.json)

The same with municipalities and cities.

Here is for Metro Manila:

[municities-province-47-metropolitanmanila.topo.0.1.json](https://github.com/faeldon/philippines-json-maps/blob/master/topojson/municities/hires/municities-province-47-metropolitanmanila.topo.0.1.json)
